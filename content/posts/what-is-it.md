This is a change from rithythul.com to rithy.org is a life reflection that I want to dedicated my works to service humaniterian efforts. 

In the past 10 plus years, I have been very fortunate to have met many great people whom become my mentors, supporters, and friend. I have been recieving so much supports from them. It's time to give more, so life can be more whole.

This personal website is reflect on that experience; my works, my play, my life, some principle, philosophy,and anything that made up to my being.
